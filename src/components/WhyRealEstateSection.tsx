          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white italic">
            "Real Estate is so old-school people earn money through Crypto, SMMA, Dropshipping, trading etc. nowadays"
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white italic">

          </p>
          
          <p>
            Notice the world around if there is any building near you, then that is real estate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So you see every skyscraper or farmhouse is owned by someone,
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white">
            This means as long as humanity is alive we will keep making buildings and that is why real estate is evergreen.

            But the same cannot be said for other business models.
