          </p>
          
          <p>
            People ask me "Why Real Estate?"
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white italic">
            "Real Estate is so old-school people earn money through Crypto, SMMA, Dropshipping, trading etc. nowadays"
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white italic">
            "How does Real Estate stand apart from them?"
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Well, wherever you are now I want you to get up and go outside.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Notice the world around if there is any building near you, then that is real estate.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So you see every skyscraper or farmhouse is owned by someone,
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white">
            This means as long as humanity is alive we will keep making buildings and that is why real estate is evergreen.
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white">
            So there is literally no limit to how much money you can make in this industry.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Also, this industry is the only one out of all the new-age business models which cannot be completely dominated by AI, becauseâ€¦
          </p>

            Ultimately real estate will only be owned by a human and not a machine.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But the same cannot be said for other business models.
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-bold text-white">
            So here is how you can learn how you can make quick money from real estate -
