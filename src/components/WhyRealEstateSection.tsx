            **Everything changed after that**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I started getting these results for myself and other agents -

          </div>
          
          <p>
            **I started posting on social media**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **Took my business online**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **But then I was forced to take the toughest decision of my life**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **Instead of encouraging and appreciating to adapt to the changes, my agency discouraged it**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **They wanted me to use the traditional ways**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But I didn't want it,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So after a lot of arguments,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I did the thing which I should have done before,
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">I Quit...</h3>
          
          <p>
            Yes, you read it right,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I did it,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **I pulled the plug on the Agency with which I worked for so long**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **But they weren't ready to change and grow**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **I had outgrown them so there was no point in me being with them**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So I kept doing my own stuff,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But I have to admit it,
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">I was scared</h3>
          
          <p>
            **Because I had left the one job that paid me the most**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **Now this was a very risky move**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But one day,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **I got a phone call**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **One company contacted me after seeing my social media**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **They said they wanted me to join their insurance agency**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **I hesitated at first because I thought it would be like my old company**,
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

            But they were not,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **When I explained how I operate and I won't do it any other way**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **They told me that it was exactly what they wanted**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **They wanted to partner with me and train their agents in my way**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **They wanted my social media expertise**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **Now this company was newly founded where they combined financial services with tech**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **They also used a franchise and agency broker model where they would train agents to start a branch of our agency and get a commission in return**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **There I made a target of 1000 licensed agents in 1 year who would be encouraged to start their own agency**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **So I refined my skills further while teaching other insurance agents how to sell online**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **And I made the biggest invention of my life without being a scientist**,

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Introducing the Faceless Insurance Company Model</h2>
          
          <p>
            **Now I wanted to train agents as quickly as possible and help them make money too**,
          </p>
          
          <p>
            **So I decided why not come up with a franchise style of teaching without the franchise fee**,
