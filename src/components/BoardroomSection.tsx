            Yes, you read it right,
          </p>

          <p>
            I am not like your typical guru,
          </p>

          <p>
            **Being 15 years in the insurance industry** I had a lot of experience and I was **handsomely paid for it**,
          </p>

          <p>
            **Until 5 years ago I was making 6 figures as an insurance agent along with my wife**,
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought my life couldn't get more perfect,
          </p>

          <p>
            **But then my family grew, we had kids**,
          </p>

          <p>
            Now if you are an experienced insurance agent,
          </p>

          <p>
            **You know that 5-6 years ago agents used to meet and sell in person**,
          </p>

          <p>
            Funny isn't it meeting people in person, driving to where they are, something which hardly happens nowadays,
          </p>

          <p>
            But anyway you know the struggle right,
          </p>

          <p>
            **So working 10 hours was getting difficult after being a parent**,
          </p>

          <p>
            **This is why I started thinking of ways to reduce the time I gave to work while earning the same income**,
          </p>

          <p>
            And when I was just exploring that,
          </p>

          <p className="font-bold text-white">
            2020 came,
          </p>

          <p>
            And I don't need to tell you what happened in that year,
          </p>

          <p>
            **Covid hit us**,
          </p>

          <p>
            **Everything in the industry went upside down**,
          </p>

          <p>
            And….
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white">Life Slapped Me in the Face</h3>

          <p>
            Up until now, everything was comfortable for me,
          </p>

          <p>
            **But now we can't meet people due to restrictions**,
          </p>

          <p>
            **Paperwork had to be done remotely**,
          </p>

          <p>
            And all sorts of things.
          </p>

          <p>
            **So yeah my company reacted and we went selling policies on Zoom**,
          </p>

          <p>
            But I knew that this was not enough,
          </p>

          <div className="space-y-2">
            <p>❌**Now we cannot advertise the traditional way**,</p>
            <p>❌**We couldn't prospect the traditional way**,</p>
          </div>

          <p className="font-bold text-white underline">
            Now everything was online,
          </p>

          <p>
            **So I searched on the Internet to buy courses and mentorships to learn how to sell online**,
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
